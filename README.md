🔐 Protect Yourself from Keyloggers

A beginner-friendly front-end project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that educates users about keyloggers, unsafe input fields, and safe habits when typing sensitive information on shared or public devices. [cite:5]

🌟 Project Overview

This single-page website explains: 
- What keyloggers are and why they are dangerous (in simple language).
- Where keyloggers might be found (like public computers or infected devices).
- How to stay safe when entering passwords or other sensitive data. 

It also includes a small interactive demo area showing **safe vs unsafe** input practices, without recording or storing any real keystrokes. [cite:5]

🧰 Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic structure)  
- CSS3 (basic responsive styling)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (beginner-friendly, no frameworks, no backend)

Everything runs just by opening `index.html` in a browser.

.
├── index.html    # Main single-page website
├── style.css     # Styles for layout, colors, and components
└── script.js     # Simple interactive logic for the demo section

Each file is kept simple and well-commented so beginners can read and modify the code easily. [cite:2][cite:5]

 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  
3. Explore the sections to learn about keyloggers and try the interactive safe/unsafe input demo. [cite:5]  

No installation, build tools, or server setup required.

🎯 Learning Goals

This project is designed to help beginners: 
- Practice basic HTML structure and content organization.  
- Use CSS to create clean, readable sections/cards.  
- Add simple JavaScript interactions without advanced concepts.  
- Understand basic security awareness around input fields and public devices.

✅ Future Improvements (Ideas)

- Add more visual examples of safe vs unsafe situations.  
- Include a mini quiz for users to test their knowledge.  
- Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility (ARIA labels, better contrast).
